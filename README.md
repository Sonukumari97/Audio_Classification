# Audio_Classification
Sound Classification is one of the most widely used applications in Audio Deep Learning. It involves learning to classify sounds and to predict the category of that sound. This type of problem can be applied to many practical scenarios e.g. classifying music clips to identify the genre of the music, or classifying short utterances by a set of speakers to identify the speaker based on the voice.

In this work, we use he Urban Sound 8K dataset that consists of a corpus of ordinary sounds recorded from day-to-day city life. The sounds are taken from 10 classes such as drilling, dogs barking, and sirens. Each sound sample is labeled with the class to which it belongs. The Dataset contain :

For this we use following library as follows :
 - sklearn
 - matplotlib
 - librosa : package for music and audio analysis and to use MFCC as feature extractor 
 - tensorflow

Using DNN give 94% accuracy.
